checkio elementary mission boolean algebra

In this mission you should implement some boolean operations:
- "conjunction" denoted x ∧ y, satisfies x ∧ y = 1 if x = y = 1 and x ∧ y = 0 otherwise.
- "disjunction" denoted x ∨ y, satisfies x ∨ y = 0 if x = y = 0 and x ∨ y = 1 otherwise.
- "implication" (material implication) denoted x→y and can be described as ¬ x ∨ y.
If x is true then the value of x → y is taken to be that of y.
But if x is false then the value of y can be ignored;
however the operation must return some truth value and there are only two choices, 
so the return value is the one that entails less, namely true.
- "exclusive" (exclusive or) denoted x ⊕ y and can be described as (x ∨ y)∧ ¬ (x ∧ y).
It excludes the possibility of both x and y.
Defined in terms of arithmetic it is addition mod 2 where 1 + 1 = 0.
- "equivalence" denoted x ≡ y and can be described as ¬ (x ⊕ y).
It's true just when x and y have the same value.
Here you can see the truth table for these operations:

 x | y | x∧y | x∨y | x→y | x⊕y | x≡y |
--------------------------------------
 0 | 0 |  0  |  0  |  1  |  0  |  1  |
 1 | 0 |  0  |  1  |  0  |  1  |  0  |
 0 | 1 |  0  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  0  |
 1 | 1 |  1  |  1  |  1  |  0  |  1  |
--------------------------------------
You are given two boolean values x and y as 1 or 0 and you are given an 
operation name as described earlier. You should calculate the value and return it as 1 or 0.

Input: Three arguments. X and Y as 0 or 1. An operation name as a string.

Output: The result as 1 or 0.
